This Shiny application is designed to help analysing trading strategies.

*How to use the App as it is?
The App requires a csv file containing returns data.  The file can be uploaded from your local machine, and must have two columns: date and daily return. 

The code is comprised of two files:
-ui.R: controls the layout and appearance of the app
-server.R: contains the instructions needed to build the app. You can load as much strategies as you want as long as the corresponding csv file has the right format (see below).

Put ui.R and server.R file in a separate directory.
